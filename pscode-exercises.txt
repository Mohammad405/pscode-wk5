// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

.Take the Modulo of the number by 2 .
.Check if the result of last opration equal to zero:
     .if it is, the number is Even.
     .else the number is Odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

.Ask the user to give you five (intergers) number .
.Get the result of adding all numbers divided by 5 to get the  average.
.Find the minimum number by campare one number to another and get the smallest numeber.
.Find the maximum number by campare one number to another and get the largest number.
.Print "The average numbers is: " plus the result of step b.
.Print "The minimum numbers is: " plus the first part of step c.
.Print "The maximum number is: "  plus the last part of step c.
